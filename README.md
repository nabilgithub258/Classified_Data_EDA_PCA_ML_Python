# Project Title: Classified Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project involves extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), principal component analysis (PCA), and classification modeling on a classified dataset. Due to the nature of the data, the specific meanings of the columns were not disclosed, which limited our capacity to perform more detailed EDA. Despite these limitations, we tested several classification models, with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) achieving the highest accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is classified, meaning that the specific meanings of the columns were not disclosed. This limited our ability to perform more detailed EDA.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed extensive EDA to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset. Due to the classified nature of the data, the specific meanings of the columns were not disclosed but we did our best with most correlated feature columns.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Applied PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and identify the most important components. This step helped in simplifying the dataset for better visualization and modeling.

## Classification Models

Tested several classification models to predict the target variable. The models included:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Results

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.86. This model was selected as the best-performing classifier for this dataset.
